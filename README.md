### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an Aerospace Engineering PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin and Mechanical Engineering graduate (BS/MS with highest honors) from the National Technical University of Athens with a wide engineering background in control theory, robotics, computational engineering, and machine learning. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on ML for model reduction and control of high-dimensional, nonlinear systems, with an emphasis on turbulent flows.
