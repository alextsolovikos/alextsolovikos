### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am an Aerospace Engineering PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin and Mechanical Engineering graduate (BS/MS with highest honors) from the National Technical University of Athens with a wide mathematical and programming background in control theory, computational engineering, and machine learning. 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on ML for model reduction and control of high-dimensional, nonlinear systems, with an emphasis on turbulent flows.
- ðŸŒ± Some of the topics that I have worked on include stochastic optimal control, high-performance computing, deep learning models for trajectory prediction, reinforcement learning, fluid dynamics, adjoint-based aerodynamic shape optimization, and computational geometry.
