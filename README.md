### Hi there 👋


I am an Aerospace Engineering PhD candidate at The University of Texas at Austin working on ML for model reduction and control of high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. 

🔭 Some of my interests include: model predictive control; reinforcement learning; environment perception for automotive applications; simultaneous localization and mapping; vision and radar object detection; transformer-based architectures for motion prediction; HD maps; computational geometry; and high-performance computing.
